# Bengaluru_house_price_prediction


 **Bengaluru House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
          This project predicts house prices based on property features such as location, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and BHK using a **Random Forest                 Regression** model.
          This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices and allows users to interact with the model through a simple web interface.

  **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning (Regression)
  **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor
  **Evaluation Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)


  **liberaries used**:Numpy,
                      Pandas,
                      Scikit-learn
  **Objectives**

- Build a supervised machine learning model for house price prediction
- Perform proper data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics
- Deploy the trained model as a web application
